=== Features ===
- Fast & small
- Self injecting (no third-party exes required)
- Featuring mouse, keyboard and Xbox controller polling, Discord RPC and a map renderer
- Easy to setup in both new and existing projects


=== New environment variables ===
-- GetInput --
(o)   mousexpos, mouseypos: mouse position measured in cells
(o)   click: mouse click ; left=1,right=2,middle=4
(o)   wheeldelta: up=-1,down=1 ; reset this manually once you process
(o)   keyspressed: is formatted like this: -keycode1-keycode2-keycode3- ; uses virtual key codes, not characters, keycode reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes; that means keyboard layouts do not matter, the physical location of keys is considered
(o)   controller#: xbox controller with index # state ; # = number between 1 and 4
(i)   noresize: 1 to disable resizing
(i)   rasterx, rastery: turn on the raster font and set its size to x and y ; can be changed after injection
(i)   limitMouseX, limitMouseY: limit the x and y range of mouse, unsets mousexpos or mouseypos if out of range ; can be changed after injection
(i)   ctrl_deadzone: deadzone for the controllers' thumbsticks in %'s
(i)   getinput_tps: how many times should the main loop run per second

All input variables are *optional*


-- Discord RPC --
(i)   discordappid - your own app id (created on the discord developer portal)
(i+o) discordupdate - set this to anything on startup and when updating the rpc; gets nulled on update
(i)   discordstate - state (for example "Editing main.c")
(i)   discorddetails - details (for example "Line 50; column 100")
(i)   discordlargeimg - name of the asset that gets used as the large image
(i)   discordlargeimgtxt - text when user mouses over the large image
(i)   discordsmallimg - name of the asset that gets used as the small image
(i)   discordsmallimgtxt - text when user mouses over the small image

-- Map Renderer --
(i)   levelWidth - width of the level
(i)   levelHeight - height of the level
(i)   viewXoff - X offset of the camera
(i)   viewYoff - Y offset of the camera
(i)   mapFile - name of the file containing the current map

i=in,o=out


=== Example setup ===
-- GetInput --

set /a mousexpos=mouseypos=click=wheeldelta=0 & :: Reset the variables
rundll32 getinput.dll,inject

-- Discord RPC --

set /a discordappid=0000000000000000000 &:: fill in your own obviously
set discordstate=Hello world
set discorddetails=Test
set discordlargeimg=big-img
set discordlargeimgtxt=Large image text
set discordsmallimg=small-img
set discordsmallimgtxt=Small image Test
rundll32 discord_rpc.dll,inject

-- Map renderer --

set /a levelWidth=113
set /a levelHeight=78
set /a viewYoff=0
set /a viewXoff=0
set mapFile=map.txt
rundll32 map_rndr.dll,inject
